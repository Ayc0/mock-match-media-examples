This repository shows an example of how to use `mock-match-media` to mock `matchMedia` in a [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) repository.

It uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) to handle the tests, Ã¥nd [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) [react-only](https://github.com/Ayc0/react-only) to handle the logic, and [mock-match-media](https://github.com/Ayc0/mock-match-media) to mock `match-media` for Jest.
